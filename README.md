COVID19 is currently spreading rapidly. This project is an effort by volunteers to design and build quickly emergency medical supplies. We use the open source model.

Currently we have the following projects:
1. RespiratorApparatus - a minimal respirator that uses an electric motor and sensors to pump using a BVM. Tidal volume and BPM can be set.
2. HalfVentillator - a minimal ventillator that does not use BVMs, and can run for weeks continuously. This will have more features than the RespiratorApparatus, but much less features than a regular ventillator.
3. HMask - a stitch free easy to make mask, made from filter paper used in cars.
